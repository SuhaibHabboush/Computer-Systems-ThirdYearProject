Database Design:

JSON was chosen as the database file because it will enable us to quickly and easily store our created objects and retreive them as needed.
JSON compatablility with java is strong and so the object model will make it very easy for us to store everything that we need to.

We will have our database be local to servers, so there will be for this prototype one database that grows out in this context:
{
  "Houses" : {
      "Doors" : {
        "requests" : {
          "PASS_MSG" : MessageObject[],
          "IMG_MSG" : MessageObject[],
          "D_STAT_MSG" : MessageObject[],
          "LK_MSG" : MessageObject[],
        },
        "State" : boolean,

      },
      "Passcode" : String,
      "Users" : {
        "Username" : String,
        "Password" : String,
        
      }

  }
}
